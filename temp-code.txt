        <h2>About Hamza</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Hamza, a grade 11 student currently attending Manitoba Institute
          of Trades and Technology (MITT) & Fort Richmond Collegiate (FRC).<br />In
          my spare time, you can find me playing various sports such as squash,
          taekwondo, hockey, soccer and many more! I also enjoy biking and
          volunteering in the community.<br />I excel and perform very well in
          academics and maintain a 98% average whilst receiving many academic
          awards in STEM-related competitions. I am a focused, hard-working and
          dedicated student with strong work ethics.<br />
          addition to being athletic and focused on academics, I regularly
          assist in the community - whether it be raising money for charities,
          babysitting, or teaching programming to aspiring kids.
