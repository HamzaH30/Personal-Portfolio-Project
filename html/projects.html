        <p>
          Over the past few years, I have worked on numerous projects both, in
          school and outside of school. The following are very diverse projects
          that I've worked on over the last few years.

              Best in Computer Science Project - Blockchain & Pharmaceutical

            <p class="project-title">
              Detecting Counterfeit Medicine in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain
              Using Blockchain Technology
            </p>
            <p>
              In grade 8, I had participated in the Acadia Junior High science
              fair. This time I was researching the topic of blockchain
              technology. I was also reading about how an increase of
              counterfeit medicines had caused a lot of people in underdeveloped
              areas serious illnesses and in most cases, death. I wanted to
              develop a model of using blockchain technology and integrate it
              into the pharmaceutical industry. I participated in the Acadia
              Junior High science fair and won the Best in Computer Science
              award and a gold medal.

              The Effects of Financial News on Investor(s) Behaviour in The
              Stock Market
            </p>
            <p>
              In grade 7, I once again participated in the science fair. This
              time I decided to do an independent project. My science fair was
              titled "The Effects of Financial News on Investor Behaviour in the
              Stock Market". I had worked on my science fair project for more
              than 4 months! In this science fair project, I improved my
              research, presentation, and report-writing skills. I used proper
              terminology in different parts of my report which my judges
              commended. For my test subjects, I had various people from
              different age groups and experience in the stock market
              participate in my experiment. In the Acadia Junior High science
              fair, I won a gold medal and a Best in Grade award. In the
              Manitoba Schools Science Symposium (MSSS) I won a silver medal.

            <h3>Best Overall Group Project</h3>
            <p>
              In 2018, my friend and I had been working on a science fair
              project for about 3 months. Our science fair project was called:
              "Does temperature affect the bounce of a tennis ball?" We had
              conducted multiple experiments during different conditions to see
              the result and test our hypothesis. In the Manitoba Schools
              Science Symposium (MSSS) we had won a gold medal, Best Overall
              Group Project, and a special award from Engineers Geoscientists
              Manitoba. This was a very interesting experience for me and helped
              spark my interest in science and science fairs.
